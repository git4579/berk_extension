**Context**
Imagine receiving a coupon for a nearby restaurant on your phone while driving. Would you detour to the restaurant immediately, use it later, or ignore it altogether? The same goes for a bar or coffee house coupon. Does weather or time of day affect your decision?

**Project Objective**
In this project, we aim to analyze the factors that influence whether drivers accept coupons or not. We will leverage visualizations and probability distributions to distinguish between customers who accepted driving coupons and those who did not.

**Data Source**
Our dataset comes from the UCI Machine Learning repository, gathered through an Amazon Mechanical Turk survey. It contains various driving scenarios, coupon types, weather conditions, passenger details, and more.

**Key Questions**
How do different coupon types impact acceptance rates?
Does weather or time of day affect coupon acceptance?
How do user attributes like age, gender, and marital status correlate with coupon acceptance?
Deliverables
Our findings will be publicly available on GitHub, accompanied by insightful visualizations and analysis.

**Independent Investigation**
Additionally, we will conduct an in-depth exploration of a specific coupon group to understand the characteristics of passengers who accept those coupons. We will focus on breaking down acceptance rates by weather and gender.

**Hypothesis**
We hypothesize that younger drivers without kids and higher income levels are more likely to accept bar coupons. Weather and time of day might also play a role in influencing acceptance rates.
